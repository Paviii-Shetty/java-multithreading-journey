# ðŸ§µ Java Multithreading Examples

This repository demonstrates two foundational approaches to creating threads in Java:

1. **Extending the `Thread` class**
2. **Implementing the `Runnable` interface**

These are crucial building blocks in Java's multithreading and concurrency model. Understanding both approaches helps Java developers write efficient and responsive applications.

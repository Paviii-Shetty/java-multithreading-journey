# java-multithreading-journey

`java-multithreading-journey` is a comprehensive learning path for mastering multithreading and concurrency in Java. This repository provides practical code examples from basic thread creation using `Runnable` and `Thread` to advanced tools like `ExecutorService` üöÄ, `Locks` üîê, `Semaphores`, and `ForkJoinPool`. Concepts are clearly organized by topic for easy learning.

------------------------

## üìö What You Will Learn

- Thread creation techniques using `Thread` class and `Runnable` interface  
- Thread lifecycle and management  
- Synchronization basics with `synchronized` blocks and methods  
- Inter-thread communication using `wait()`, `notify()`, and `notifyAll()`  
- Working with daemon threads and thread priorities  
- Using high-level concurrency utilities:  
  - `ExecutorService` and thread pools  
  - `Callable` and `Future`  
  - Locks (`ReentrantLock`, `ReadWriteLock`)  
  - Synchronizers like `CountDownLatch`, `Semaphore`, `CyclicBarrier`  
  - Concurrent collections  
  - ForkJoin framework
